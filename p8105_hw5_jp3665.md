## Washington Post homicide data

This data gathered by the Washington Post contains information about the
victim, location, and disposition of over 52,000 homicides that occurred
over the past decade in 50 of the largest cities in the U.S.

### Clean Washington Post homicide data

Make data frame of total and unsolved homicides in each city.

``` r
homicide_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")

homicide_data <- homicide_data %>%
  mutate(.keep = "all", city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "))

head(homicide_data)
```

## Longitudinal experimental data

This data is collected from a longitudinal study with control and
experimental subjects.

### Import and tidy data

Import individual data files, combine into data frame, add sample ID and
experimental/control arm columns.

``` r

### Plot observations for each subject over time

Make spaghetti plot of subject data over time.

``` r
con_exp_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = subject_id, color = arm)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Observed Values for Control and Experimental Subjects Over Time") +
  xlab("Week Number") +
  ylab("Observed Value") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

This plot demonstrates that the observations for subjects in the
experimental arm of the trial increase during the duration of the study
and are generally higher than the observations for subjects in the
control arm.
